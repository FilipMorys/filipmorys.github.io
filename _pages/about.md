Over 50% of worldwide population suffers from overweight and obesity. Past work shows that obesity is highly heritable, and that the interaction between genetics and environment determines individual weight. Our work suggests that this is driven by changes in the brain that are related to phenotypes such as impulsivity and, ultimately, increased food intake and weight gain. Thus, we recognise obesity as a disorder rooted in the brain.

Conversely, chronic obesity can lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. My work explores both sides of this obesity-brain interactions and aims to determine what factors put children at risk of weight gain and what are the mechanisms that link obesity to brain atrophy. Ultimately we will use this knowledge to craft prevention and intervention strategies that are aimed at improving life quality of the population.

I currently work at the Montreal Neurological Institute as a research associate. Please have a look at my website and CV to learn more about my work and myself.
