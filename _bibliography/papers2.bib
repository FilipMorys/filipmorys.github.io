  abstract = "Obese individuals discount future rewards to a higher degree than
              lean individuals, which is generally considered disadvantageous.
              Moreover, their decisions are altered more easily by
              decision-irrelevant cues. Here, we investigated neural correlates
              of this phenomenon using functional MRI. We tested 30 lean and 26
              obese human subjects on a primed delay discounting paradigm using
              gustatory and visual cues of positive, neutral and negative
              valence to bias their intertemporal preferences. We hypothesised
              that activation differences in reward-related and behavioural
              control areas, and changes in connectivity between these areas,
              would reflect the effect of these cues. Here, obese subjects were
              more susceptible to priming with negative gustatory cues towards
              delayed choices as opposed to lean subjects. This was related to
              lower activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during
              priming. Modulation of functional connectivity between the dlPFC
              and the ventromedial PFC by the behavioural priming effect
              correlated negatively with BMI. This might indicate that default
              goals of obese individuals were different from those of lean
              participants, as the dlPFC has been suggested to be involved in
              internal goal pursuit. The present results further our
              understanding of the role of the PFC in decision-making and might
              inform future weight-management approaches based on non-invasive
              brain stimulation.",

  abstract = "Brain atrophy has been reported in the early stages of
              Parkinson's disease, but there have been few longitudinal
              studies. How intrinsic properties of the brain, such as
              anatomical connectivity, local cell-type distribution and gene
              expression combine to determine the pattern of disease
              progression also remains unknown. One hypothesis proposes that
              the disease stems from prion-like propagation of misfolded
              alpha-synuclein via the connectome that might cause varying
              degrees of tissue damage based on local properties. Here, we used
              MRI data from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to map
              the progression of brain atrophy over 1, 2 and 4 years compared
              with baseline. We derived atrophy maps for four time points using
              deformation-based morphometry applied to T1-weighted MRI from 120
              de novo Parkinson's disease patients, 74 of whom had imaging at
              all four time points (50 Men: 24 Women) and 157 healthy control
              participants (115 Men: 42 Women). In order to determine factors
              that may influence neurodegeneration, we related atrophy
              progression to brain structural and functional connectivity,
              cell-type expression and gene ontology enrichment analyses. After
              regressing out the expected age and sex effects associated with
              normal ageing, we found that atrophy significantly progressed
              over 2 and 4 years in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus
              and posterior cortical regions. This progression was shaped by
              both structural and functional brain connectivity. Also, the
              progression of atrophy was more pronounced in regions with a
              higher expression of genes related to synapses and was inversely
              related to the prevalence of oligodendrocytes and endothelial
              cells. In sum, we demonstrate that the progression of atrophy in
              Parkinson's disease is in line with the prion-like propagation
              hypothesis of alpha-synuclein and provide evidence that synapses
              may be especially vulnerable to synucleinopathy. In addition to
              identifying vulnerable brain regions, this study reveals
              different factors that may be implicated in the neurotoxic

              adversely affecting brain health in aging. Our aim was to
              investigate interrelations between subjective sleep-related
              symptoms, obesity, cardiometabolic disorders, brain structure and
              cognitive decline in a population-based aging sample. METHODS:
              Data were extracted from the UK Biobank for anthropometric and
              demographic information, self-reported sleep behaviours,
              cardiometabolic measures, structural brain magnetic resonance
              imaging and cognitive test scores. ``Sleep-related symptoms''
              (SRS) were measured using four questionnaire items: loud snoring,
              daytime sleepiness, likelihood to nap and difficulty getting up
              in the morning. Associations were tested using a structural
              equation model (SEM), adjusted for confounders. Further, multiple
              regression analysis was used to test for direct relationships
              between SRS and specific cognitive domains. RESULTS: Among 36,468
              participants with an average age of 63.6 (SD 7.5) years and
              46.7\% male, we found that SRS were associated with obesity and
              several pre-existing cardiometabolic disturbances. In turn,
              cardiometabolic disorders were associated with increased white
              matter hyperintensities and cortical thinning, which were related
              to cognitive dysfunction. SRS were also directly related to
              several structural brain changes and to cognitive dysfunction.
              Regression analyses showed that SRS were directly associated with
              slower reaction times, and lower scores in fluid intelligence,
              working memory and executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported
              sleep-related symptoms were associated with cognitive dysfunction
              directly and through pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders and
              brain structural alterations. These findings provide evidence
              that symptoms of sleep disturbances, here defined primarily by
              hypersomnolence and snoring, are important risk factors or
              markers for cognitive dysfunction in an aging population.",

              healthy young men that fall into the lower or upper end of that

              cross-sectional study does not provide evidence for diet-related
              differences in WM stability and flexibility in men, nor for a
              predisposition of COMT Val158Met or Taq1A genotype to the
              hypothesized detrimental effects of an HFS diet. Previously

              Recently, excess weight has also been related to brain atrophy
              and cognitive decline. Reports show that obesity is linked with
              Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related changes, such as cerebrovascular
              damage or amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation. However, to date no
              research has conducted a direct comparison between brain atrophy
              patterns in AD and obesity. OBJECTIVE: Here, we compared patterns
              of brain atrophy and amyloid-$\beta$/tau protein accumulation in
              obesity and AD using a sample of over 1,300 individuals from four
              groups: AD patients, healthy controls, obese otherwise healthy
              individuals, and lean individuals. METHODS: We age- and
              sex-matched all groups to the AD-patients group and created
              cortical thickness maps of AD and obesity. This was done by
              comparing AD patients with healthy controls, and obese
              individuals with lean individuals. We then compared the AD and
              obesity maps using correlation analyses and permutation-based
              tests that account for spatial autocorrelation. Similarly, we
              compared obesity brain maps with amyloid-$\beta$ and tau protein
              maps from other studies. RESULTS: Obesity maps were highly
              correlated with AD maps but were not correlated with
              amyloid-$\beta$/tau protein maps. This effect was not accounted
              for by the presence of obesity in the AD group. CONCLUSION: Our
              research confirms that obesity-related grey matter atrophy
              resembles that of AD. Excess weight management could lead to
              improved health outcomes, slow down cognitive decline in aging,

              BMI are related to genes expressed in the central nervous system.
              At the same time, higher BMI is associated with neurocognitive

              Motivation theories of obesity suggest that one of the brain
              mechanisms underlying pathological eating and weight gain is the
              dysregulation of dopaminergic circuits. Although these
              dysregulations likely occur at the microscopic level, studies on
              grey matter volume report macroscopic differences associated with
              obesity. One region suggested to play a key role in the
              pathophysiology of obesity is the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We
              performed a meta-analysis of findings regarding NAcc volume and
              overweight/obesity. We additionally examined whether grey matter
              volume in the NAcc and other mesolimbic areas depends on the
              longitudinal trajectory of obesity, using the UK Biobank dataset.
              To this end, we analysed the data using a latent growth model,
              which identifies whether a certain variable of interest (eg, NAcc
              volume) is related to another variable's (body mass index [BMI])
              initial values or longitudinal trajectories. Our meta-analysis
              showed that, overall, NAcc volume is positively related to BMI.
              However, further analyses revealed that the relationship between
              NAcc volume and BMI is dependent on age. For younger individuals,
              such a relationship is positive, whereas, for older adults, it is
              negative. This was corroborated by our analysis in the UK Biobank
              dataset, which includes older adults, where we found that a
              higher BMI was associated with a lower NAcc and thalamus volume.
              Overall, the present study suggests that increased NAcc volume at
              a young age might be a vulnerability factor for obesity, whereas,
              at an older age, decreased NAcc volume with increased BMI might
              be an effect of prolonged influences of neuroinflammation on the

              were present in all participants. Avoiding vs. approaching food
              was associated with higher activity in the right angular gyrus
              (rAG). CBM resulted in a diminished approach bias towards
              unhealthy food, decreased activation in the rAG, and increased
              activation in the anterior cingulate cortex. Relatedly,
              functional connectivity between the rAG and right superior
              frontal gyrus increased. Analysis of brain connectivity during
              rest revealed training-related connectivity changes of the
              inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyri. Taken
              together, CBM strengthens avoidance tendencies when faced with
              unhealthy foods and alters activity in brain regions underpinning
              behavioral inhibition.",

              is characterized by episodes of uncontrolled eating, within
              discrete periods of time. Although it is usually described in
              obese individuals or as a symptom of Binge Eating Disorder (BED),
              this behavior can also occur in the normal-weight (NW)
              population. An interesting premise suggests that impulsivity
              might contribute to the onset of binge eating and the progression
              toward weight gain. Drawing upon this evidence, here we explored
              impulsivity in NW individuals reporting binge-eating episodes
              through a functional connectivity approach. We hypothesized that,
              even in the absence of an eating disorder, NW binge eaters would
              be characterized by connectivity pattern changes in
              corticostriatal regions implicated in impulsivity, similarly to
              the results described in BED individuals. Methods: A
              resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested
              39 NW men and women, with and without binge eating (binge eaters,
              BE and non-BE). Brain functional connectivity was explored by
              means of graph theoretic centrality measures and traditional
              seed-based analysis; trait impulsivity was assessed with
              self-report questionnaires. Results: The BE group was
              characterized by a higher degree of trait impulsivity. Brain
              functional connectivity measures revealed lower degree centrality
              within the right middle frontal gyrus, left insula/putamen and
              left temporoparietal regions and a lower functional connectivity
              between the right middle frontal gyrus and right insula in the BE
              group. Discussion: The results support previous evidence on BED
              of altered functional connectivity and higher impulsivity at the
              roots of overeating behavior, but further extend this concept
              excluding any potential confounding effect exerted by the weight

              motivational dimensions---approach and avoidance. These have been
              related to frontal hemispheric asymmetries in clinical and
              resting-state EEG studies: Approach was linked to higher activity
              of the left relative to the right hemisphere, while avoidance was
              related to the opposite pattern. Increased approach behaviour,
              specifically towards unhealthy foods, is also observed in obesity
              and has been linked to asymmetry in the framework of the
              right-brain hypothesis of obesity. Here, we aimed to replicate
              previous EEG findings of hemispheric asymmetries for
              self-reported approach/avoidance behaviour and to relate them to
              eating behaviour. Further, we assessed whether resting fMRI
              hemispheric asymmetries can be detected and whether they are
              related to approach/avoidance, eating behaviour and BMI. We
              analysed three samples: Sample 1 (n = 117) containing EEG and
              fMRI data from lean participants, and Samples 2 (n = 89) and 3 (n

              related to EEG, but not to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. In
              Sample 2, approach/avoidance behaviours were related to fMRI
              hemispheric asymmetries. Finally, hemispheric asymmetries were
              not related to either BMI or eating behaviour in any of the

              regarding hemispheric asymmetries and indicates that this
              relationship could also be captured using fMRI. Our findings
              suggest that eating behaviour and obesity are likely to be

               piecemeal knowledge of the mechanisms linking obesity to central
               nervous system damage. Adiposity leads to the metabolic
               syndrome, consisting of inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia
               and insulin resistance. In turn, these metabolic abnormalities
               cause cerebrovascular dysfunction, which may cause white and
               grey matter tissue loss and consequent cognitive impairment.
               While there have been several neuroimaging studies linking
               adiposity to changes in brain morphometry, a comprehensive
               investigation of the relationship has so far not been done. Here
               we use structural equation modelling applied to over 14,000
               individuals from the UK Biobank to identify the causal chain
               that links adiposity to cognitive dysfunction. We found that
               body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were positively related
               to higher plasma C-reactive protein, dyslipidemia, occurrence of
               hypertension and diabetes, all of which were in turn related to
               cerebrovascular disease as measured by volume of white matter
               hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. White mater
               hyperintensities were associated with lower cortical thickness
               and volume and higher subcortical volumes, which were associated
               with cognitive deficits on tests of visuospatial memory, fluid
               intelligence, and working memory among others. In follow-up

               mediated 20\% of the relationship between obesity and
               cerebrovascular disease and that cerebrovascular disease
               mediated a significant proportion of the relationship between
               obesity and cortical thickness and volume. We also showed that
               volume of white matter hyperintensities was related to decreased

              emotion-related changes in food processing remains elusive. Here,
              we designed an emotional priming fMRI task to test if amygdala
              activity during food pictures differs depending on the emotional
              context. Fifty-eight female participants completed a novel
              emotional priming task, in which emotional images of negative,
              neutral, or positive situations were followed by pictures of
              either foods or objects. After priming in each trial,
              participants rated how much they liked the shown foods or
              objects. We analyzed how brain activity during the contrast
              ``foods > objects'' changed according to the emotional

               substrates of BMI and their neurobiological underpinnings remain
               unclear. Studying 325 healthy young adults, we examined

               patterns along continuous hierarchical axes that dissociate low

               differentiation between unimodal and heteromodal association
               networks in individuals with higher BMI, indicative of an
               increasingly segregated modular architecture and a disruption in
               the hierarchical integration of different brain system.
               Transcriptomic decoding and subsequent gene enrichment analyses

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: Chronic obesity is associated with several
               complications, including cognitive impairment and dementia.
               However, we have only piecemeal knowledge of the mechanisms
               linking obesity to central nervous system damage. Among
               candidate mechanisms are other elements of obesity-associated
               metabolic syndrome, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
               diabetes, but also systemic inflammation. While there have been
               several neuroimaging studies linking adiposity to changes in
               brain morphometry, a comprehensive investigation of the
               relationship has so far not been done. OBJECTIVE: To identify
               links between adiposity and cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: This
               observational cohort study (UK Biobank), with an 8-year
               follow-up, included more than 20 000 participants from the
               general community, with a mean age of 63 years. Only
               participants with data available on both baseline and follow-up
               timepoints were included. The main outcome measures were
               cognitive performance and mediator variables: hypertension,
               diabetes, systemic inflammation, dyslipidemia, gray matter
               measures, and cerebrovascular disease (volume of white matter
               hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging). RESULTS: Using
               structural equation modeling, we found that body mass index,
               waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat percentage were positively
               related to higher plasma C-reactive protein, dyslipidemia,
               hypertension, and diabetes. In turn, hypertension and diabetes
               were related to cerebrovascular disease. Finally,
               cerebrovascular disease was associated with lower cortical
               thickness and volume and higher subcortical volumes, but also
               cognitive deficits (largest significant pcorrected = 0.02).
               CONCLUSIONS: We show that adiposity is related to poor
               cognition, with metabolic consequences of obesity and
               cerebrovascular disease as potential mediators. The outcomes
               have clinical implications, supporting a role for the management
               of adiposity in the prevention of late-life dementia and

              control might be at the roots of overeating and binge eating
              disorder (BED). The majority of these results stems from studies
              on obese populations, however we hypothesized that potential
              prodromes might be evident also in non-clinical conditions, when
              binge eating episodes are present (without a diagnosis of BED)
              and a normal Body Mass Index is preserved. To explore this issue,
              brain activity of 42 normal weight individuals with and without
              binge eating episodes (21 binge eaters and 21 non-binge eaters,
              BE and non-BE respectively) was assessed by means of functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during response inhibition
              tasks. We adopted a food-modified version of a go/no-go (GNG) and
              stop signal task (SST): these tasks investigate different aspects
              of inhibitory control (action restraint and cancellation) that
              have been rarely studied in the same individuals but that are
              known to involve different neural networks. In addition,
              impulsivity traits were assessed with self-report instruments.
              Despite similar behavioral performances, the two groups differed
              in trait impulsivity and brain activity. The fMRI results
              revealed differential engagement of fronto-striatal regions
              between the groups during the tasks. The BE group, compared to
              non-BE, showed lower activation of the right middle frontal gyrus
              (MFG) and Putamen during the GNG task, and higher activation of
              the left MFG during the SST. These findings provide evidence of a
              dissociation of the neural underpinnings of action restraint and
              cancellation in impulsive individuals. Moreover, they add support
              to the hypothesis that impulsivity may be a possible hallmark of
              binge eating behavior (in the absence of weight or full-blown
              eating disorders) and yield new insights on the role of regions
              typically involved in response inhibition and selection as
              possible substrates of impulsive eating.",

               heritable. Further, it shares phenotypical and genetic variance
               with body mass index (BMI) and impulsivity. Yet, to what extent
               this trait is related to single genetic variants and
               physiological or behavioral features is unknown. We investigated
               the genetic basis of head motion in a meta-analysis of
               genome-wide association studies. Further, we tested whether
               physiological or psychological measures, such as respiratory
               rate or impulsivity, mediated the relationship between BMI and
               head motion. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association
               meta-analysis for mean and maximal framewise head displacement
               (FD) in seven population neuroimaging cohorts (UK Biobank,
               LIFE-Adult, Rotterdam Study cohort 1-3, Austrian Stroke
               Prevention Family Study, Study of Health in Pomerania; total N =
               35.109). We performed a pre-registered analysis to test whether
               respiratory rate, respiratory volume, self-reported impulsivity
               and heart rate mediated the relationship between BMI and mean FD
               in LIFE-Adult. Results No variant reached genome-wide
               significance for neither mean nor maximal FD. Neither
               physiological nor psychological measures mediated the
               relationship between BMI and head motion. Conclusion Based on
               these findings from a large meta-GWAS and pre-registered
               follow-up study, we conclude that the previously reported
               genetic correlation between BMI and head motion relies on
               polygenic variation, and that neither psychological nor simple
               physiological parameters explain a substantial amount of
               variance in the association of BMI and head motion. Future
               imaging studies should thus rigorously control for head motion

  abstract  = "Smell perception plays a role in eating behavior and might be
               involved in the development of obesity. In fact, olfactory
               function is impaired in obesity and might depend on metabolic
               health factors. To date, the underlying neural mechanisms remain
               unclear. Here, we investigate neural processing of food-related
               odors in normal-weight, overweight and obese individuals.
               Fifty-three young and healthy participants (28.8 $\pm$ 4.4
               years, 27 female; 24 normal-weight, 10 overweight, and 19 obese)
               were presented with high- (chocolate, potato chips) and
               low-caloric (orange, cucumber) food odors during a functional
               magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also assessed olfactory
               identification ability, body mass index (BMI), body fat
               percentage, insulin resistance, and leptin levels. In brief,
               olfactory perception of food odors was linked to brain activity
               in the entorhinal and piriform cortex, and the insula,
               hippocampus, and amygdala. Insulin resistance was negatively
               related to olfactory identification. Additionally, perception of
               sweet versus savory odors was related to a higher brain activity
               in the right middle/superior frontal gyrus. Finally, we found no
               effect of obesity status, BMI, metabolic factors, or body fat
               percentage on neural responses to food odors. Overall, this
               suggests that food odor processing might depend on factors other
               than body weight status or associated markers of metabolic
               health.",

  abstract  = "Background: Impulsivity increases the risk for obesity and
               weight gain. However, the precise role of impulsivity in the
               aetiology of overeating behavior and obesity is currently
               unknown. Here we examined the relationships between
               personality-related measures of impulsivity, Uncontrolled
               Eating, body mass index (BMI), and longitudinal weight changes.
               In addition, we analyzed the associations between general
               impulsivity domains and cortical thickness to elucidate brain
               vulnerability factors related to weight gain. Methods: Students
               (N = 2318) in their first year of university---a risky period
               for weight gain---completed questionnaire measures of
               impulsivity and eating behavior at the beginning of the school
               year. We also collected their weight at the end of the term (N =
               1177). Impulsivity was divided into three factors: stress
               reactivity, reward sensitivity and lack of self-control. Using
               structural equation models, we tested a hierarchical
               relationship, in which impulsivity traits were associated with
               Uncontrolled Eating, which in turn predicted BMI and weight
               change. Seventy-one participants underwent T1-weighted MRI to
               investigate the correlation between impulsivity and cortical
               thickness. Results: Impulsivity traits showed positive
               correlations with Uncontrolled Eating. Higher scores in
               Uncontrolled Eating were in turn associated with higher BMI.
               None of the impulsivity-related measurements nor Uncontrolled
               Eating were correlated with longitudinal weight gain. Higher
               stress sensitivity was associated with increased cortical
               thickness in the superior temporal gyrus. Lack of self-control
               was positively associated with increased thickness in the
               superior medial frontal gyrus. Finally, higher reward
               sensitivity was associated with lower thickness in the inferior
               frontal gyrus. Conclusion: The present study provides a
               comprehensive characterization of the relationships between
               different facets of impulsivity and obesity. We show that
               differences in impulsivity domains might be associated with BMI
               via Uncontrolled Eating. Our results might inform future
               clinical strategies aimed at fostering self-control abilities to
               prevent and/or treat unhealthy weight gain.",

               substrates of BMI and their neurobiological underpinnings remain
               unclear. Studying 325 healthy young adults, we examined
               associations between functional connectivity and
               inter-individual BMI variations. We utilized non-linear
               connectome manifold learning techniques to represent macroscale
               functional organization along continuous hierarchical axes that
               dissociate low level and higher order brain systems. We observed
               an increased differentiation between unimodal and heteromodal
               association networks in individuals with higher BMI, indicative
               of a disrupted modular architecture and hierarchy of the brain.
               Transcriptomic decoding and gene enrichment analyses identified
               genes previously implicated in genome-wide associations to BMI
               and specific cortical, striatal, and cerebellar cell types.
               These findings illustrate functional connectome substrates of
               BMI variations in healthy young adults and point to potential
               molecular associations. Bo-yong Park et al. use non-linear

               brain connectivity and inter-individual body mass index (BMI) in
               325 young adults. They supplement these analyses with existing
               transcriptomic data, altogether suggesting several neural and
               molecular associations that may underlie BMI variations in
               healthy young adults.",
